Docstring for exercises.drink_water_reminder

Create a python program that reminds the user to drink water at regular intervals.

The program should:
- Take the interval time in minutes as input from the user.
- Use the time module to create a timer that waits for the specified interval.
- After each interval, display a reminder message to the user to drink water.
- Optionally, use a sound notification to alert the user (you can use the playsound library for this).
